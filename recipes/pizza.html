        <h2> How to make pizza jambon Step by Step</h2>

           <ol> <h3>DIRECTION</h3>

               <li> Position 1 oven rack in the center and
                    the second rack on the bottom of the oven
                     and preheat to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle
                     the cornmeal over 2 rimless baking 
                     sheets. Roll out each piece of Pizza 
                     Dough into a 10- to 11-inch round. 
                     Transfer 1 dough to each prepared baking sheet.</li>

                <li>Spoon the Marinara Sauce over the dough, 
                    dividing equaling and leaving a 1-inch border
                     around each pizza. Sprinkle the cheeses over 
                     the sauce. Arrange the pineapple pieces in a 
                     single layer over the cheeses. Sprinkle with 
                     the ham. Bake the pizzas until the crusts are
                     crisp and brown on the bottom and the cheese
                     is melted on top, about 12 minutes. Cut the 
                     pizza into wedges and serve immediately.</li>
             </ol>

                <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
             <ol>
                     <li>Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend. 
                    Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes.
                     Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend.
                      Blend in the oil. With the machine running, 
                      add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms.
                     Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 
                     about 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the
                      dough to coat with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic 
                      wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the 
                      dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour. Punch the down
                       dough and divide into 2 equal balls.</li>  
             </ol>
                  <h3>Marinara Sauce</h3>
            <ol>
                  <li>In a large casserole pot, heat the oil over a medium-high 
                      flame. Add the onions and garlic and saute until the onions
                       are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add 
                    the celery, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon of each
                     salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables 
                     are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes 
                     and bay leaves, and simmer uncovered over low 
                     heat until the sauce thickens, about 1 hour. 
                     Remove and discard the bay leaf. Season the 
                     sauce with more salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
